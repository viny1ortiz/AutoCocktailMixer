# Automatic Cocktail Mixer

This is a project we had at university where engineers from different areas (Electrica, Mechatronical, Mechanical, and Industrial) were grouped to design an Automatic Cocktail Mixer. My main roles as the Electrical Engineer in the group were: **Circuit Design**, **BOM**, **Power consumption calculation**, and **Program Flow Chart**. I won't upload the whole project here, instead, I will focus on the electrical part.

# Design Concept

To give you a basic idea of what the product looks like, we came up with this design, in which you put your glass in the cocktail mixer, select your drink and the machine prepares it for you. The machine has 8 tanks on the sides which store the beverage and, according to the selected cocktail, would then mix and serve it to you.

# Circuit Design and BOM

In terms of PCBs, there are 9 in total, which the main one located on the front side of the device, and the other 8 above each container to control the liquid level of it. See more details in the "Circuit Diagram" and "Electrical_BOM" files.
